The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!
Well, what do you want?
I'm not a witch.
Burn her!
He hasn't got shit all over him.
Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!
You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!
Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person!
I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!
I dunno.
Must be a king.
Bloody Peasant!
Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
Well, she turned me into a newt.
Well, how'd you become king, then?
I dunno.
Must be a king.
Burn her!
We found them.
Why?
Well, I got better.
We want a shrubbery!!
I am your king.
I'm not a witch.
And the hat.
She's a witch!
Camelot!
The nose?
Be quiet!
Now, look here, my good man.
And this isn't my nose.
This is a false one.
Now, look here, my good man.
But you are dressed as oneâ€¦
We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us.
We want a shrubbery!!
I am your king.
Why?
He hasn't got shit all over him.
Look, my liege!
The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!
Oh!
Come and see the violence inherent in the system!
Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Oh!
Come and see the violence inherent in the system!
Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!
What a strange person.
Well, she turned me into a newt.
You don't vote for kings.
I dunno.
Must be a king.
We want a shrubbery!!
And this isn't my nose.
This is a false one.
And the hat.
She's a witch!
Shh!
Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home.
Let us ride to Camelot!
Well, we did do the nose.
